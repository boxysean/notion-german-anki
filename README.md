## notion-german-anki

### Requirements

This project is to allow my Notion German bank to be my "source of truth" for my Anki dictionary. It has the following aims:

1. Easily extract Notion table to create Anki notes / cards, with specific tags for my ease-of-use.
2. Retain the Anki stats if I make any updates.

### How to run

1. Run `main.py --token xyz` to generate a deck called `output.apkg`
2. Import `output.apkg` into Anki on computer
3. Sync Anki to main database
